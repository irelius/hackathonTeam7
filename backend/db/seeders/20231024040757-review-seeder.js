It's sleek, sturdy, and minimalist, just as described. The only reason it's not a full 5 stars is because I'd prefer it in a slightly larger size. But overall, I'm quite satisfied.",

If you love the Rococo style, this is for you, but I found it too ornate. Honestly, I don't know why this product is listed on this site.",
