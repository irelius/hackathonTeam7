## Getting started

* To start locally run 'npm i' in the root directory 
* cd into backend and run 'npx dotenv sequelize db:migrate' to get the database setup.

### Next there are two ways to start the application
1. Cd back into the root directory and run 'npm run together' this will run the backend and frontend concurrently, in one terminal. 

2. Open another terminal cd into frontend in one terminal and cd into backend in the other. Run 'npm start' in both the frontend and backend directories in order to start the application.

* Navigate to localhost:3000 to interact with the frontend.
